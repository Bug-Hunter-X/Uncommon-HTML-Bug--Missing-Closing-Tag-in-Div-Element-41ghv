# Uncommon HTML Bug: Missing Closing Tag in Div Element

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug: a missing closing tag for a div element. This bug can lead to unexpected rendering behavior in browsers, as the content following the unclosed div may be rendered incorrectly or not at all.

**The bug:** The `bug.html` file contains a div element that is missing its closing tag. This causes the rest of the HTML to be interpreted incorrectly.

**The solution:** The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the corrected version of the HTML with the closing tag added. The correctly structured HTML renders as expected in any browser.

This example is a simple demonstration, but the principle applies to all HTML tags and can lead to more complex issues in larger codebases.  Always ensure that all opening tags have corresponding closing tags to avoid unexpected behavior.
